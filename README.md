# About Me

**selmersignus/selmersignus** is a ★ _special_ ★ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🐙 I’m currently working on relearning github to host a workshop that will teach students github basics.
- 💻 I’m currently learning C++.
- 🌫️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment.
- 🌫️ I’m looking for help with ... again, nothing.
- 🗣️ Ask me about AI.
- ❔ How to reach me: ... it's a mystery...
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been playing Disco Elysium recently.
